# Home Finder Application

This site is essentially a zillow style web app

## What I Have Done

This project was mostly set up for me, all the changes that I have made are found in the src/app directory. The CSS files in that directory were provided.

## How to run

Once you have the repo cloned in your IDE first run this line in the correct directory (should be first-app-lesson-00):

npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm start

After you run that you will then run

ng serve

Now open localhost:4200 on your local machine and the code should display!

## Credits
